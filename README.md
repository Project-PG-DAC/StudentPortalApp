# StudentPortal
“SystemPortal”, an online student website, was developed by our project team to provide a platform for PG Diploma courses of IACSD Pune students. We tried using the latest technologies that are cross-platform and robust. Each and every software we used was open-source in nature, which keeps the cost of production minimal.
